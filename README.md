A machine learning model that classifies compounds as hits (active) or inactive against their biological targets.

The dataset used here; AID688 is the result of a primary screen for Yeast eIF2B from the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery and contains activity information of 27,198 compounds with a ratio of 1 active compound to 108 inactive compounds (0.91% minority). The screen is a reporter-gene assay and 25,656 of the compounds have known drug-like properties
